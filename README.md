### Info
This application was written in Golang as an exercise, it is not intended to be
fully featured or idiomatically written. If you're looking for a practical
solution the [spark](https://github.com/holman/spark) may be your best option.

### Todo
This stuff will probably never happen but they might be useful

* ~~Make it terminal aware so that the default width is the current terminal
width~~
* Add vertical orientation in the style of sparklines
* Add option for different colours
* Add option for removing labels (needed for vertical orientation)
* Make this into a library with an example application
